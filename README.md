# SD Assignment 2

## Description

The assignment goal was to develop a client / server implementation of the "Game of the Rope", as described in the [description of the assignment](description.pdf) provided by the course's professor. The solution was implemented in Java 21 and is built on top of the previous assignment (that uses reentrant locks to ensure mutual exclusion and condition variables to ensure synchronization between threads). Each envolved entity is now encapsulated in a process running on seperate machines, that communicate by exchanging messages with the use of TCP sockets.

The game is played by two teams, each with 5 players and 1 coach. A referee is responsible for the flow of the game. There is a [general interaction diagram](general-interaction-diagram.pdf) to help understand the game's flow, and a [client interaction diagram](client-interaction-digram.pdf) and a [server interaction diagram](server-interaction-diagram) to help understand how the client and server logic are implemented.

The following entities were defined:

- `Referee`: organizes the game and ensures that the rules are followed.
  - The referee thread is encapsulated in the `Referee` client.
  - Client of the `Referee Site` and `Playground` servers.
- `Coach`: responsible for preparing the team for the game.
  - The 2 coach threads are encapsulated in the `Coach` client.
  - Client of the `Contestants Bench`, `Referee Site` and `Playground` servers.
- `Contestant`: responsible for playing the game.
  - The 10 contestant threads are encapsulated in the `Contestant` client.
  - Client of the `Contestants Bench` and `Playground` servers.

To allow synchronization between the threads, that are running in each process, the following information sharing regions were defined:

- `Referee Site`: where the referee shares the game state with the coaches.
  - The referee site monitor is encapsulated in the `Referee Site` server.
  - Server of the `Coach` and `Referee` clients.
  - Client of the `General Repository` server.
- `Playground`: where the contestants play the game.
  - The playground monitor is encapsulated in the `Playground` server.
  - Server of the `Contestant`, `Coach` and `Referee` clients
  - Client of the `General Repository` server.
- `Contestants Bench`: where the contestants wait for their turn to play.
  - The contestants bench monitor is encapsulated in the `Contestants Bench` server.
  - Server of the `Contestant` and `Coach` clients.
  - Client of the `General Repository` server.
- `General Repository`: where the state of the game is logged by the referee site, playground and contestants bench.
  - The general repository monitor is encapsulated in the `General Repository` server.
  - Server of the `Contestants Bench`, `Referee Site` and `Playground` servers.

**Course:** Distributed Systems (2023/2024).

## Running the program

- Run `./build.sh` in root to compile, distribute and compress the execution environment of each entity.
- Open 7 terminals and deploy and run each entity to a separate machine (remember to be connected to the university's VPN).
  - Run `./coach.sh` for the Coach client.
  - Run `./contestant.sh` for the Contestant client.
  - Run `./referee.sh` for the Referee client.
  - Run `./contestants_bench.sh` for the Contestants Bench server.
  - Run `./playground.sh` for the Playground server.
  - Run `./referee_site.sh` for the Referee Site server.
  - Run `./general_repository.sh` for the General Repository server.

**Note:** Change values in `.env` file to the pretended configuration of the deployment. 

## Logging

Logs of the runs are saved in the `logs` directory where the General Repository server is running. The logs are named according to `<timestamp>.log`.

## Documentation

JavaDoc documentation can be found in the `docs` directory. Open `index.html` in a browser to access it.
